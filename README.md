# Linear Data Structures
Linear data structures are data structures whose elements are stored in non-hierarchical way where each element has the
successors and predecessors except the first and last element. There are four types namely: Arrays, Stacks, Linked Lists, and Queues as illustrated below.  

## 1. Arrays  
**Definition:** A linear data structure that stores a collection of elements in contiguous memory locations. This allows the computer to calculate the position of any element using a mathematical formula based on its index. 

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Fixed Size:** Traditionally allocated with a set size; resizing requires creating a new array and copying data.
- **Zero-Based Indexing:** The first element is at index 0.
- **Access Speed (O(1)):** Direct access to any element via its index is nearly instantaneous.
- **Modification Speed (O(n)):** Inserting or deleting from the middle requires "shifting" all subsequent elements to maintain the contiguous order.
- **Cache Friendliness:** Due to contiguous storage, arrays are highly optimized for modern CPU architectures.

**Best Use Case:** When you need fast random access to data and the total number of elements stays relatively constant.

## 2. Stacks
**Definition:** A Stack is a linear data structure that serves as a collection of elements with two principal operations: push and pop. It operates on the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle—meaning the most recent element added is the first one to be removed.

**Real-World Analogy:** Cafeteria Trays: You place a new tray on top of the pile (Push). When someone needs a tray, they take the one that was just placed there (Pop).

**Key Characteristics:**  
- **Unidirectional:** Access is restricted to a single end (The Top).  
- **Recursive Nature:** Stacks are used internally by operating systems to manage function calls (the "Call Stack").  
- **Memory Efficiency:** Since elements are only added/removed from the top, there is no need to "shift" elements like in an Array.

**Operations:**  
- **Push:** Adds an element to the Top of the stack.
- **Pop:** Removes the element from the Top of the stack.
- **Peek:** Returns the top element without removing it.
- **isEmpty:** Checks if the stack contains any elements.

## **3. Queues**

**Definition:** A Queue is a linear data structure that operates on the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. In a queue, the first element added is the first one to be removed, much like a real-life waiting line.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Enqueue:** Adding an element to the back (rear) of the queue.  
- **Dequeue:** Removing an element from the front of the queue.  
- **Peek/Front:**	Returns the front element without removing it.  
- **IsFull/isEmpty:** Checks the capacity or state of the queue

**Real-world Analogy:** The first person to arrive at the counter in a coffee shop is the first person served.

## **4. Linked Lists**

**Definition:**  
A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous (adjacent) memory locations. Instead, the elements are linked using pointers.  
Each element is called a Node, which acts as a container for both the data and the address of the next item in the sequence. 

**Real-world Analogy:** A Scavenger Hunt. You find the first clue (Head), which tells you where the second clue is, which tells you where the third clue is.

The Head: The very first node in the list. If you lose the Head, you lose the whole list.  

A node is typically represented as a record or object with two fields:  
- **Data:** The actual value being stored (Integer, String, etc.  
- **Next:** A reference (pointer) to the subsequent node. The last node's next pointer is null or None.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Dynamic Size:** Unlike standard arrays, linked lists can grow or shrink during execution without expensive resizing/copying.  
- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions:** Adding or removing elements doesn't require "shifting" the entire structure; you only need to update the pointers of the surrounding nodes.  
- **Memory Overhead:** Uses more memory than an array because it must store a next pointer for every single piece of data.

**Operations:**  
- **Access/Search:** Finding a specific value by traversing from the Head.
- **Insert (at Head):** Creating a new node and making it the new Head.
- **Insert (at Tail):** Traversing to the end to link a new node.
- **Delete (at Head)** Moving the Head pointer to the second node

# Non-linear Data Structures
Non-linear data structures arrange data elements hierarchically or interconnectedly rather than sequentially, allowing for multi-level relationships
There are two types of non-linear data structures namely: Trees and Graphs

## Trees
A Tree is a non-linear data structure representing a hierarchy. It consists of Nodes connected by Edges  
Trees are chosen when you need to store data that has a natural hierarchy or when you need faster searching than a Linked List but more flexibility than a sorted Array.  

**Real-World Analogy:** In companies, the CEO is at the top, Managers are below them, and individual contributors are at the bottom.  

**Key Terminology**  
- Root: The topmost node of the tree (the starting point).
- Parent / Child: A node directly above another is the parent; the nodes below it are children.
- Leaf: A node with no children (the "end" of a branch).
- Subtree: Any node and all its descendants can be viewed as a smaller tree within the larger one.
- Height: The number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf
